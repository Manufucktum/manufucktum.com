        "desc": "We have seen tremendous growth around NFTs and Metaverse for the past year, but very little understanding of how artists can participate. We have developed a way for analog artists to enter the web3 and created an interface for artists and collectors to interact and share their experiences of owning and creating NFTs with the community. With this project, we want to promote digital awareness and affinity among artists and give them another tool for digital self - promotion. Furthermore, to use the process for this, to show artists* and the visitors* that through Smart Contracts the art world completely new facets for the interaction of art, artist and viewer become possible. For this purpose, we build a physical space in which artists of all art forms can exhibit.The room is equipped with cameras and permanently transmits the content of the room via livestream.On our platform, users can control various parameters of the space and the artworks(light, color, music, etc.) and thus directly enter into an exchange and participate.",

        "description": "In the first installation, the artist Matthew Push fills our space with his deconstruction of a sound game. Dissected into its individual parts and connected by 'invisible' threads, which in turn are equipped with paper kites, the sound game is stimulated by a fan periodically alternating at two points by the turbulence generated. The repetitions (iterations) overlap and create their own dynamics in rhythm and intensity through the linked (interdependent) thread system. The installation can be viewed live for 2 weeks. The artist sets the deconstructed sound play in 10 audio-visual frames that represent different emotions and thus set the sound experience in its own context. The interplay of these emotional frames with the iteratively stimulated sound play is also to be understood as an allegory of Jaques Derrida's concept of iteration, in which each individual takes in information incompletely and at the same time this information affects several levels in the subject itself, which the individual must first bring into balance. The frames each symbolise a framework that our senses set for us in the context of a social setting as well - through emotions, among other things, but also in the form of interpretive patterns and classifications - and, by this, involve the observer in the experience of subjective perception. The first emotional frame has been available as NFT directly since the start of the exhibition. The other 9 were created during the 10-day live performance and are also available as NFTs.",

Since more than 20 years, he realizes installations of nets generated by hooking and stringing cooked spaghetti together. For Netzartig Fliegende Teigwaren the noodle structure is attached to a horizontal bicycle wheel set in motion by a motor. Tangled skeins of spaghetti dangle from the wheel. By rotating the mesh-like structure its shape widens to a more spherical appearance. The banal substance of cooked noodles takes on a delicate immaterial quality. The machine was originally created for the 2012 solo exhibition at Contemporallye art space in Augsburg where it had vaster dimensions and therefore appeared as the Flying Spaghetti Monster.",
